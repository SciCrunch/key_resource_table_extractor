The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (30 mL) and the aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 50 mL). Combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc : PE 50 : 50 to 100 : 0) and HPLC afterwards. Product fractions were lyophilised yielding compound SW-C210 as a white solid (72 mg, 0.18 mmol, 28 %).
