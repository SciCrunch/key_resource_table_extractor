Supernatant was then extracted to undergo digestion with 500 ng of Porcine Trypsin (Promega) and 500 ng of Endopeptidase Lys-C (Wako) in 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate overnight at room temperature. Digestion was halted by addition of neat trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides underwent reversed phase based micro solid phase extraction.",
