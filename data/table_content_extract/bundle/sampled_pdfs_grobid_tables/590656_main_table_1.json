Sections were imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. For quantification, high magnification images (367.38 µm x 367.38 µm with a pixel size of 0.71 µm) with a z-stack size of 1 µm were taken. Because ipRGCs are a sparse population of RGC, regions of interest (ROIs) around Opn4 mRNA or mCherry mRNA (Fig. 2B, fig. S3, fig. S4, fig. S6 and fig.",
