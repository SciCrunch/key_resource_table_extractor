  "caption": ". (A) Comparative analysis of dorsal skin appearance at different ages, with detailed 18-mont-old view (right, square area amplified). (B) Representative skin sections showing cumulative alterations in hair follicle homeostasis including cysts at 2-month-old (square area amplified below) before macroscopic alterations are noted. As noted in the graph, all GRK2 eKO animals exhibited abnormal cyst-like structures at this stage. (C) Analysis of cyst presence at different ages showed that cysts are absent in newborn or 1st telogen mouse but show a penetrance of 100% after 2nd postnatal anagen. (D) Schematic view of the differential cycling properties of skin domains. The analysis of their growing pattern in GRK2 eKO animals revealed cyst numbers peak at 8-month-old mice and a preferential growth in cycling anatomical domains such as dorsal compared to resting ear skin. Means Â± SEM data are represented, and statistical analysis was performed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test, ****p< 0.0001.",
